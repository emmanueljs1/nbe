# Normalization by Evaluation

This repository contains a formalization of Chapter 2 of Andreas Abel's habilitation thesis,
[Normalization by Evaluation: Dependent Types and Impredicativity](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/habil.pdf).

It is intended to be read as a "tutorial" in normalization by evaluation, going over a representation
of System T first and then introducing the algorithm itself along with proofs of the algorithm's
completeness and soundness.
